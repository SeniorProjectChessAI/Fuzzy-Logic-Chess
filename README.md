# Fuzzy-Logic-Chess
Fuzzy Logic Chess is a variant of chess that has integrated various war game ideas to enhance the chess playing experience. 

## The Rules of Fuzzy Logic Chess
### Capturing Pieces
* When an attack is successful, the attacking piece moves into the square of the captured piece.
* When an attack is unsuccessful, the attacking piece remains in the square it attacked from.
* All pieces may attempt to capture an opposing piece in any direction (left, right, up, down, diagonal).
* Only the Knight may move after an attack. Only the Knight may attack twice.
### Movement Variations
* In addition to their normal movement, all pieces may also move to any unoccupied neighboring square in any direction (left, right, up, down, diagonal).
* Pawns are never promoted after reaching the eighth rank (the opponent’s home row).
* For its first move, a Pawn may move two squares in a straight line.
* The Bishop, Rook and Queen may each move either diagonally or horizontally in a straight line, and may only move up to four squares (not eight).
* No declaration of “check”
### Two Actions in a Turn
* Move two different pieces OR
* Move the Bishop, Rook, or Queen twice, and they may change direction for the second move OR
* Move the Knight twice, each action either using its normal chess movement pattern, OR by moving to an adjacent square OR
* Move both the King and a Rook in a castle move OR
* Move one piece and attack with one piece (can be the same or different pieces) OR
* Make two attacks with any two pieces but move none.
### The Knight
* In F-L Chess, the Knight does not move on top of a piece to capture it as moving and capturing are separate actions. 
  * The Knight moves to an unoccupied square as normal, and then, in a second action may attack any adjacent opposing piece in any direction. 
  * Only the Knight is allowed to use two actions to make two attacks in the same turn when a second action is available: 
    * A Knight may attack the same piece again (when the first attack fails) OR
    * May attack a different piece with the second attack.
